\arguments{
\item{Distance}{Numeric. Running distance in meters (must be positive).}

\item{f}{Numeric. Empirical coefficient (slope of the relationship) referred to as the "fatigue coefficient" by Rumball (must be positive).}

\item{c}{Numeric. Empirical coefficient (intercept of the relationship).}
}
\value{
Numeric. Running velocity in m/s.
}
\description{
Calculates running velocity based on distance using Rumball's model.
