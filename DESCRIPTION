Description: ModPerformR provides a comprehensive toolkit for modeling and analyzing athletic performance records, 
    with a focus on running events. It includes various performance models (such as linear, power law, logarithmic, 
    exponential, and Riegel's model), functions to apply these models to data, and tools to compare the goodness of 
    fit of different models. Researchers and analysts can use ModPerformR to investigate trends in athletic performance, 
    predict potential record-breaking performances, and understand the factors influencing elite athletic achievements.
